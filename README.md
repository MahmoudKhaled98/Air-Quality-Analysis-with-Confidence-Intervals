# Air Quality Analysis with Confidence Intervals

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** across various U.S. states, particularly those where Ripple Renewable Energy (RRE) operates. The AQI serves as a crucial measure of air quality, where values closer to 0 indicate minimal health risks, while higher values pose increased concerns for public health. With the potential enactment of a new federal policy offering subsidies for renewable energy in states with an average AQI of 10 or above, this analysis aims to identify which states are most likely to be impacted.

The dataset includes AQI data from several states, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of the mean AQI and the construction of confidence intervals to assess the likelihood of states exceeding the specified threshold.

## Introduction

Air quality is a vital environmental health indicator, with significant implications for public health and policy. In this project, I analyze AQI data from states where RRE operates—California, Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas—to determine which states are most likely to exceed an average AQI of 10 following potential federal policy changes.

Key objectives include:
- Summarizing the mean AQI for RRE states.
- Visualizing the AQI distribution using boxplots.
- Evaluating which states may be significantly affected based on the AQI data.
- Constructing confidence intervals for the state with the highest mean AQI.

## Tools Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and exploration.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced statistical graphics.
- **SciPy**: For statistical functions and confidence interval calculations.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into four main steps:
- **Step 1: Imports**: Importing necessary libraries for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Step 2: Data Exploration**: Examining the dataset's structure and generating descriptive statistics.
- **Step 3: Statistical Analysis**: Conducting mean AQI summaries, visualizations, and constructing confidence intervals.
- **Step 4: Results and Evaluation**: Analyzing results and providing insights based on the statistical findings.

## Data Exploration and Statistical Analysis

### Step 1: Imports
The required libraries are imported for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

### Step 2: Data Exploration
I load and explore the dataset to understand its structure and the characteristics of the `aqi` (Air Quality Index) column. Key questions addressed include:
- What does the AQI column represent?
- What are the descriptive statistics, including the mean and count of the AQI column?
- Are there any missing values in the AQI data?

### Step 3: Statistical Analysis
I summarize the mean AQI for each state where RRE operates and visualize this using boxplots. The analysis aims to identify which states are most likely to exceed the AQI threshold of 10. Additionally, I construct a confidence interval for the state with the highest mean AQI by following a structured four-step process:
1. Identify a sample statistic.
2. Choose a confidence level.
3. Find the margin of error.
4. Calculate the confidence interval.

### Step 4: Results and Evaluation
I present visualizations of the AQI distributions and evaluate the confidence interval results for the state with the highest AQI, discussing their implications in relation to the federal policy under consideration.

## Key Insights


- The mean AQI for California and Michigan suggests they may frequently exceed the threshold of 10, warranting attention for potential policy impacts.
- **California's AQI**: The observed mean AQI for California highlights the need for focused intervention in this state, as it is a critical area for air quality improvement.
- **Confidence Interval Results**: A 95% confidence interval calculated from the sample data yielded [10.36, 13.88]. This range indicates a 95% confidence that the population mean AQI for California falls between 10.36 and 13.88, significantly greater than the threshold of 10.
- **Impact of Varying Confidence Levels**: Altering the confidence level affects the interval size; for instance, a 99% confidence level results in an interval of [9.80, 14.43], demonstrating a wider range.
- **Methodological Transparency**: The analytical process and methodology used to construct the confidence interval are thoroughly documented in this notebook, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.
- **Consideration of Limitations**: It is important to acknowledge potential shortcomings, such as the short time period referenced, which may impact the robustness of our conclusions.


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the significance of **confidence intervals** in evaluating environmental data. By assessing AQI levels across multiple states, I provide actionable insights that can inform policy decisions regarding renewable energy subsidies and public health initiatives. The findings underline the importance of statistical analysis in guiding effective environmental policies.
